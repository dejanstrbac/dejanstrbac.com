<h1>Deliverability Is An Invented Word</h1>
<p>
In the realm of email systems, the term "deliverability" is frequently used, but it's a somewhat invented, murky, and often misunderstood concept, reminiscent of the world of SEO (Search Engine Optimization).
</p>
<p>
When people talk about deliverability in email, they're essentially discussing how effectively they can ensure their emails reach the recipient's mailbox. However, the question arises: why should anyone else have such control over our own mailboxes, and why should they be allowed to boast about it? The concept of deliverability illustrates the lack of user control within email systems.

<p>
Moreover, when someone boasts about achieving "high deliverability," doesn't this essentially create an open invitation for spammers? The mere existence of this concept suggests that there is a vulnerability that allows undesired messages to infiltrate our mailboxes. Practices such as warming up IPs/domains, sender certification, and "whitelisting" are just a few examples of such vulnerabilities, and numerous companies offer services exploiting these loopholes. As a result, the email experience for regular users is compromised, and their inboxes remain under the control of corporate interests. This is utter failure of email.
