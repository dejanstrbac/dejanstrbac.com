<h1>Jurisdiction Is Not An Email Feature</h1>
<p>
 It's essential to debunk a common misconception. Providers, regardless of their claims, will cooperate with local governments when legally compelled. The distinction lies in how different jurisdictions handle these requests. Some may permit public disclosure, while others impose penalties for such revelations.
</p>
<p>
  The bottom line is that all governments engage in collaboration, but the specific terms of that cooperation are not publicly disclosed.
</p>
<p>
Messaging systems should not rely on the promises of providers or their physical locations for privacy and secrecy.
